## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

WIG is a self-hosted inventory management service to remember "What I Got".<br>
It is built for the everyday person in need of organization.<br>
WIG-Server is the backend database manager that handles all functionality behind the application.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
The WIG-Server is only needed if the plan is to Self-Host.
A free tier is available for all with access to the [WIG-Android](https://github.com/Narrow-Code/WIG-Android) application.

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
To run the WIG-Server, Docker is required as all components are containerized. Please ensure Docker is installed on your system before proceeding with the installation. If Docker is not yet installed, you can install it by following [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Initial Setup <a name="initial-setup"></a>
- To setup the WIG-Server clone the repository to the desired directory in your server.
- In the wIG-Server directory, rename .envTemplate to .env
- Make any personal changes to .env
- Any changes made to .env must be changed in docker-compose.yml
- From the WIG-Server directory, run the following command:

```bash
docker stack deploy â€”compose-file docker-compose.yml wig
```
- After running this command, WIG-Server should be containerized and running on Port 30001
- Follow instructions on [WIG-Android](https://github.com/Narrow-Code/WIG-Android) to setup Self Hosting for the Android Application.
